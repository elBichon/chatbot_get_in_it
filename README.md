# chatbot_get_in_it
<h2>chatbot for a get in it and cap gemini competition</h2>
<ul>
  <li>train the system to recognize the language</li>
  <li>for now it will be done through asking the user his favourite language</li>
  <li>train it to translate in a few language</li>
  <li>The bot is now able to understand/talk english, french, german and spanish</li>
</ul>
<em>Due to lak of time, no real custom dataset was created and this one had to be manually handcrafted Therefore the bot may seem very stupid as he lacks vocabulary</em>

<h2>run the cells in the jupyter notebook chatbot_competition_final</h2>

<p>it will first generate a bin file and parse the json to generate a vocabulary corpus then It will run different neural networks LSTM to create the chatbot finally it will propose to chat</p>

<em>Once again, due to lack of time, the bot was ponctually trained on testing dataset never on the fnal one therefore I am not able to provide abias and weights file and can only hope the bot isable to perform</em>
