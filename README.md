# chatbot_get_in_it
##chatbot for a get in it and cap gemini competition
*train the system to recognize the language
*for now it will be done through asking the user his favourite language
*train it to translate in a few language
The bot is now able to understand/talk english, french, german and spanish

*Due to lak of time, no real custom dataset was created and this one had to be manually handcrafted*
*Therefore the bot may seem very stupid as he lacks vocabulary*

run the cells in the jupyter notebook chatbot_competition_final

it will first generate a bin file and parse the json to generate a vocabulary corpus

then It will run different neural networks LSTM to create the chatbot

finally it will propose to chat

*Once again, due to lack of time, the bot was ponctually trained on testing dataset never on the fnal one*
*therefore I am not able to provide abias and weights file and can only hope the bot isable to perform*
